# file-upload-preview
: Create a responsive web page with a file drop area that allows users to upload documents of various formats. Once a file is dropped, the content should be previewed within the webpage. Additionally, provide a text area for users to input search terms; any matching text in the uploaded document should be highlighted in the preview.
